Developing for the Curator
==========================

First download all the dependencies and data files that are unavailable via
maven repos using the `boostrap.sh` script:

 >     $ pwd
 >     /home/james/curator-src
 >     $ sh bootstrap.sh

You should now be able to build everything using ant.

 >     $ pwd
 >     /home/james/curator-src
 >     $ ant dist

This will create a `dist` directory which contains all the jars, scripts and
documentation required to run the Curator and the annotators.

Each individual component can be built using ant from the component's
directory. Some even have test targets.
