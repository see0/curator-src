Illinois Part-of-Speech Tagger Server
=====================================

Description
-----------

This package wraps the Illinois Part-of-Speech Tagger as a Thrift server using
the Curator's Labeler interface. It is designed to be integrated into the
Curator system.


Semantics
---------

The output of the POS server is a Labeling object.  Each Span in the Labeling
has the following semantics:

* `span.label` contains a string representation of the POS tag.

Usage
-----

>     $ bin/illinois-pos-server.sh --help
>     usage: java edu.illinois.cs.cogcomp.annotation.server.IllinoisPOSServer
>            [-c <CONFIG>] [-h] [-p <PORT>] [-t <THREADS>]
>      -c,--config <CONFIG>     configuration file
>      -h,--help                print this message
>      -p,--port <PORT>         port to open server on
>      -t,--threads <THREADS>   number of threads to run


Installation
------------

The Illinois POS server depends on:

* Java >= 1.5
* Learning Based Java Library (`LBJ2Library.jar`)
* Illinois POS Tagger (`LBJPOS.jar`)
* Curator interfaces (`curator-interfaces.jar`)

In order to run the server you must install the dependencies.

Download the dependencies and move them to the curator lib directory:
 
 >     $ pwd
 >     /home/james/curator
 >     $ curl -O http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/Software/LBJ2Library.jar
 >     $ mv LBJ2Library.jar lib
 >     $ curl -O http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/Software/LBJPOS.jar
 >     $ mv LBJPOS.jar lib

Configuration
-------------

The Illinois POS Server expects the Record object to contain an annotation
representing the sentence split and tokenization.  The file configuration file
`configs/pos.properties` specifies which fields in the Record.labelViews contain
this information (defaults to `sentences` and `tokens` respectively).
