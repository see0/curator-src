Installation
------------

The Illinois Coreference server depends on:

* Java >= 1.5
* Learning Based Java Library (`LBJ2Library.jar`)
* Illinois POS Tagger (`LBJPOS.jar`)
* Illinois Coreference Resolver (`LBJCoref.jar`)
* Curator interfaces (`curator-interfaces.jar`)

In order to run the server you must install the dependencies.

Download the dependencies and move them to the curator lib directory:

>     $ pwd
>     /home/james/curator
>     $ curl -O http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/Software/LBJ2Library.jar
>     $ mv LBJ2Library.jar lib
>     $ curl -O http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/Software/LBJPOS.jar
>     $ mv LBJPOS.jar lib
>     $ curl -O http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~cogcomp/Software/LBJCoref.jar
>     $ mv LBJCoref.jar lib

Configuration
-------------

The Illinois Coreference Server expects the Record object to contain an
annotation representing the sentence split, tokenization and POS tags.  The file
configuration file `configs/coref.properties` specifies which fields in the
Record.labelViews contain this information (defaults to `sentences`, `tokens`
and `pos` respectively). Optionally it can point to the named entity field
(which it will use as mentions).
